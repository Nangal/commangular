I rewrote the TodoMVC AngularJS example to show how Commangular works. It is using some Commangular features like event aspects and flows.
The original version has almost all the code in the controller. The Commangular version remove the code from the controller and move the logic to the infrastructure layer.All the sample has been done dispatching events directly from the
view.

This example is using Commangular v.0.9.0 still unreleased. It will be released very soon.
